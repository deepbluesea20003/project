Hospital FTP Programming Project

Welcome to our project!

The main component of our code is the 'client.py' file, stored in the client folder.

To run the program, open cmd with admin privilages and run client.py

By default (e.g. with no options), the program will schedule a download on your PC for the current day at whatever time and length you'd like.

The options are:
    -h : help page
    -f, --find : uses a GUI to find a file for a specific date
    -s, --schedule [DATE]: schedules data to be sent on the date specified
    -a, --automated [PATH]: only to be used by automated scheduler

These can be passed into the program via our command line interface
